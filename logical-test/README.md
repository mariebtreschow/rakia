Write a function or algorithm that takes a string of digits and returns the number of ways it can be decoded back into its original message.

- Given the input "12", the possible decodings are "AB" and "I", so the output shouldbe 2.
- For the input "226", the possible decodings are "BZ", "VF", and "BBF", making the output 3.
- With the input "O", there are no valid decodings, resulting in an output of 0.
